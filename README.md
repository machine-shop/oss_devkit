# Open Source DevKit

Three tools to ease the life of Open Source developers:

- Command line Git module for working with GitHub, specifically GitHub PRs
- A bot
- An analytics dashboard (stalled PRs & discussions, time since last comment,
  etc.)

## Command Line
- `git hub pr -` :  Pulls down and checkout the branch of the pr. 
- `git hub push` :  Pushes changes back to a branch.
- `git hub sync` :  Updates and saves pull-requests 
- `git hub search -` :  Searches saved PRs to find any that match search keywords.
